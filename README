                             The Git Ticket Tracker


Tiget is a command line based bug tracking system with emphasis on
extensibility. It creates a separate branch in an existing git repository to
store issues, so the tickets can be distributed alongside the source code of
the managed project. This allows bugs to be handled in a truly distributed
manner.


HACKING:

PEP 8[1] should be followed for every new code.
An exception to this rule is when creating custom exceptions (no pun intended).
The pass keyword should appear on the same line as the class keyword when no
methods are overwritten in the subclass. So multiple custom exceptions may be
declared without wasting screen space.
e.g.:

    class FrobnicationNotPossible(Exception): pass
    class IDontWantToDoThis(Exception): pass

Automatic style checking and detection of common errors is possible with pep8
and pyflakes. Both tools are available on pyp.

When hacking on tiget you can install it in development mode.

    ./setup.py develop

Development mode allows to change the source code without reinstalling the
package.

Please run the test suite before opening a pull request or committing in the
master branch.

    ./setup.py nosetests

Every non-trivial code should have according tests.
